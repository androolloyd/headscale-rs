# Changes

## 2026-05-20 — workspace member trim

Four crates were demoted from `[workspace.members]` to `[workspace.exclude]`:

| Crate                | Disposition | Reason |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| `headscale-core`     | kept on disk, excluded from members | required by `headscale-api`, `headscale-db`, `headscale-cli` via path dep |
| `headscale-identity` | kept on disk, excluded from members | DID/Ed25519 infra OctraVPN doesn't use directly but kept for embedders |
| `headscale-resources`| kept on disk, excluded from members | metering surface kept for the open question on a future provider registry |
| `headscale-payments` | kept on disk, excluded from members; deletion candidate | OctraVPN uses the Octra chain; `headscale-db::payments` still depends on it and pins it alive |

### What this changes

- `cargo build --workspace`, `cargo test --workspace`, and
  `cargo clippy --workspace` no longer cover the four demoted crates
  on their own. Their tests and lint surface are only exercised when
  one of the active crates (`headscale-api`, `headscale-db`,
  `headscale-cli`) pulls them through.
- Each demoted crate has `package.publish = false` set so it cannot
  be accidentally pushed to crates.io.
- Each demoted crate has a top-level README explaining how to build
  it in isolation if needed.

### What this doesn't change

- The path-dependency graph is unchanged. `headscale-db` and friends
  still depend on `headscale-core`, `headscale-identity`,
  `headscale-resources`, and `headscale-payments` via
  `[workspace.dependencies]` path entries. Those entries don't need a
  crate to be in `[workspace.members]` to resolve, so production
  builds are byte-identical.
- No code in the active crates was modified. No cargo dependency
  versions were changed. Only `members`/`exclude` lists and the
  `publish` keys.

### Build-time impact

Cold `cargo build --workspace` does *not* meaningfully change: the
demoted crates are still in the dep tree of the active crates and
still get compiled on the way to building `headscale-cli`. The win
is structural — clippy / test scope is now restricted to the three
crates we actually maintain, and the demoted crates are flagged for
embedders as second-class.

### Why not delete `headscale-payments` outright

The original plan was to `git rm -r headscale-payments` as "option
(A)". That's blocked by `headscale-db/src/payments.rs` and
`headscale-db/src/models.rs::PaymentRow::to_transaction` referencing
`headscale_payments::ledger::*` directly. Deleting it would require
touching code in a kept crate (`headscale-db`), which was explicitly
out-of-scope for the workspace-trim commit. The crate is on the
short-list for deletion once the kept crates are decoupled.

### Why not delete `headscale-core::authorization`

The original plan suggested removing the `authorization.rs` stub
that was added during an earlier build-break fix. The current
`authorization.rs` is not dead — `headscale-core::packet` and the
forward-decision contract tests at the bottom of `packet.rs` consume
`ForwardDecision` + `authorize_forward{,_ip}`. Leaving it alone.
